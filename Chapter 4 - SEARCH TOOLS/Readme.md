Make the information work for you. That's the only reason why we use computers, because investing has been around for thousand fo years. Computeres though allow us to access and process a virtually unlimited amount of information. Unfortunately, investors do not need to process all available information (that would be impossible), but they should strive to process all available relevant information - still very difficult, but at least a constraint we can work with.

Accessing information is all about consistency, quality and quantity. Basically we want only True information, structured in the most easy to use format, and as much as possible. When looking at markets, there are at least 3 basic types of information that is required:
<li> stock prices - usually accessed through an API </li>
<li> company discolsure - usually publicly available</li>
<li> news information - just the news available for free on platforms<li>
